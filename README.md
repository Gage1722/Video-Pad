# Video-Pad
Video Pad is a Gorilla Tag mod that enhances the in-game experience by allowing players to change the time of day, yes sounds familiar! (Day and Night changer) Well yes thats what video pad is but not ratted and its a pad instead of a table! Video Pad brings a whole new level of creativity to Gorilla Tag.
